# Project Graphs - Lab activity: analysis of music networks with Spotify

This lab activity consists of 4 parts, that will be done during the remaining class sessions of the course. The 4 parts will go through the data life cycle, with the implementation of a set of functions defined in the assignments and the analysis of the obtained results.

- Part 1: Acquisition and storage of data
  
- Part 2: Data preprocessing.
  
- Part 3: Analysis.
  
- Part 4: Visualization.

As you will see in the statement of each session, the practice has two aspects: coding and analysing results. Coding needs to be done in Python (3.7 or higher). A template plain python file (.py) will be provided for each part of the activity. You need to implement all the code of each part in the given template file1 (indications of where you need to write your code are included as comments in the template). You can define additional global functions (and import any libraries) if needed, but do not include any other code in the global scope. The algorithm that implements the work for each session (the calls to the functions) needs to be included inside the main scope. The other aspect of the practice requires you to analyze the information and reflect on
some issues. These questions should be delivered in an additional PDF document. At the end of the statement of each session you will find a list detailing the files you need to deliver for that session (and their format).
